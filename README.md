 An interface to simplify Jupyter notebook management

## Problems investigated

#### Easily switching the display between 2 modes of Jupyter operation: 

Development: where it's useful to see the result of each action  
Release: the checks shouldn't be displayed so the notebook is easier to read

#### Making the notebook code higher level

Hide object manipulations

#### Learning by doing: using tab completion as cheat sheet to learn commands

## Pros & cons found so far

### Managing objects 

#### Pros  

Simplify the interface, make it higher level
Faster to perform manipulations on a single object

#### Cons

A little more verbose to use objects the standard way: g.o['object_name']
    
### Tabbing to discover functionality 

#### Pros

Simplify discovery of functionality

#### Cons

Jupyter tabbing seems to break sometimes
