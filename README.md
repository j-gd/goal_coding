# Goal Coding

 An experimental interface to:

### Make notebooks more readable

* Make notebooks higher level: encapsulating best of class approaches, managing notebook objects

* Provide 2 modes of operation: dev (debug/intermediate display) and production (no intermediate display)

### Capture best of class methods

### Help teach data science and Python

Goal-oriented tab completion and syntax description

## Learnings so far

### Making notebooks more readable, encapsulate best of class approaches, PROD and DEV modes

The approach looks promising. Would need to implement on a project to test further.

### Managing objects

#### Pros

* Simplify the interface, make it higher level
* Faster to perform manipulations on a single object

#### Cons

A little more verbose to use objects the standard way: g.o['object_name']

### Tabbing to discover functionality

#### Pros

Simplifies discovery of functionality

#### Cons

Jupyter tabbing seems to break sometimes

### Help teach data science and Python

It seems more impactful to capture best known methods to improve a data scientist's skills, than to teach basic data science and Python skills, as a fair amount of knowledge would be needed to use this library.
